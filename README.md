# JOB Tracking Application

This is a REST application develop to help me track my job applications as I apply for them

I chose java in order to learn the syntax and spring architecture for web development

For the frontend I chose react, as a memory refresher I chose React

In production: 
  The app is to be hosted in gcp kubernetes environment,
  and serve under TBD

Local development:
  The app is dockerized. Build the image and run docker up
