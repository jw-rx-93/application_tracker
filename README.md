# JOB Tracking Application

This is a REST application develop to help me track my job applications as I apply for them

I chose java in order to learn the syntax and spring architecture for web development,
not particulary because it is the best technology here (django, rails, fastapi, node are better alts for some thing so simple and low in scale)


For the frontend I chose react, as a memory refresher I chose React

In production: 
  The app is to be hosted in gcp kubernetes environment,
  and serve under TBD

Local development:
  The app is dockerized. Build the image and run docker up
